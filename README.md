# bookmarklets

Some bookmarklets I made for myself and use from time to time.

## Nice tools
- [Bookmarklet Editor](https://www.gibney.org/bookmarklet_editor): Can transform your javascript code to a pastable bookmarklet.

## How to use these?
1, Copy the code.
2. Create a new bookmark.
3. Paste the code into the url adress input.
4. Give it a title.
5. Save the new bookmark.
6. Press on it and it will run the pasted code.
